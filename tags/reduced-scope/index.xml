      <description>This week is still focused on polishing our mini-games. During our progress review with Professor Vangelis it was recommended that we not increase the scope more by adding the Void mini-game. Therefore, with the remaining weeks in this semester the team will do our best to focus on increasing the fidelity of games.
Also, based on the professor&amp;rsquo;s response to our current state of Treasure Hunter we have stepped back to see if another game environment would work better.</description>
