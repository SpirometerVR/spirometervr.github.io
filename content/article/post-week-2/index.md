It begins!
 
On a sad note, this past week one team member had to leave the course due to a class schedule change. On a happier note, our team space was setup in the USC Creative Media and Behavioural Health lab. On top of this received two Oculus Go and 3 custom made spirometers, designed by Dr. Vangelis.

On the production side we setup our team's Trello board for task management, WhatsApp group from team chat, GitHub repo for source control and shared Google Drive for everything else. Several teammates took time to play and experience VR games for the first time so that everyone has a general understanding of the gaming space we will be developing in.
 
And last, but not least, we finalize our idea being a game of mini games. This would provide more variety for the children to choose from. We select the following three mini games:

name    | description | inhale | hold | exhale
--------|------|-------|-------|---------
Save the Village | Put out fires! | collect water | hold the water | shoot water
Racing   | Yeah, a racing game! | braking | coasting | accelarating 
Pebbles | Straw + pebbles = fun! | collect pebbles | hold pebbles | place pebbles
