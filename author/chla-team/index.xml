      <description>&lt;p&gt;It begins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a sad note, this past week one team member had to leave the course due to a class schedule change. On a happier note, our team space was setup in the USC Creative Media and Behavioural Health lab. On top of this received two Oculus Go and 10 custom made spirometers, designed by Dr. Vangelis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the start of our team blog. This space is for you to be part of our teams journey on the game development progress during the Spring 2020 Augmented, Virtual &amp;amp; Mixed Reality course at USC (CSCI 538). Our team has an amazing opportunity to work on building games to make the breathing therapy process more interactive and fun for kids at the Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
