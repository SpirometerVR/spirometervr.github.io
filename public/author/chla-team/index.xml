      <description>This week we lost our Production Manager. That being said, we have elected a new PM and are still full steam ahead!
For this posting, we are stepping a back a bit to review development environment setup for the breathing games. Without further ado&amp;hellip;

      <title>Week 3: Field trip to CHLA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To become more familiar with the specific breathing protocal that is used by the children, this week the team took a little field trip to the Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles. We met with 6 doctors. It turned out that the doctors thought our VR game was going to be designed around the diagnostics protocol which each patient has to first perform at the clinic before beginning their daily protocol. This was different from Dr. Vangelis expectation of our team design the VR experience to focus on the daily protocol, so he took the time to clarify and make sure the CHLA doctors were all onboard with our team designing for the daily protocol instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It begins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a sad note, this past week one team member had to leave the course due to a class schedule change. On a happier note, our team space was setup in the USC Creative Media and Behavioural Health lab. On top of this received two Oculus Go and 10 custom made spirometers, designed by Dr. Vangelis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the start of our team blog. This space is for you to be part of our teams journey on the game development progress during the Spring 2020 Augmented, Virtual &amp;amp; Mixed Reality course at USC (CSCI 538). Our team has an amazing opportunity to work on building games to make the breathing therapy process more interactive and fun for kids at the Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
